# Context Hub

AI agents hallucinate APIs and forget what they learn in a session. Context Hub gives them curated, versioned docs — and the ability to get smarter with every task. All content is open and maintained as markdown in this repo — you can inspect exactly what your agent reads, and contribute back.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g @aisuite/chub
chub search "stripe"                 # find what's available
chub get stripe/api                  # fetch current docs
```

## How It Works

**Most of the time, it's simple — search, fetch, use:**

```bash
chub search "stripe payments"        # find relevant docs
chub get stripe/api                  # fetch the doc
# Agent reads the doc, writes correct code. Done.
```

**When the agent discovers a gap**, it can annotate locally for next time:

```bash
chub annotate stripe/api "Needs raw body for webhook verification"

# Next session, the annotation appears automatically on fetch.
```

**Feedback flows back to authors** — `chub feedback stripe/api up` or `down` — so the docs get better for everyone over time.

## Content Types

**Docs** — API and SDK references. Versioned, language-specific. "What to know."
```bash
chub get openai/chat-api --lang py   # Python variant
chub get stripe/api --lang js        # JavaScript variant
```

**Skills** — Task recipes, automation patterns, coding playbooks. Shareable across teams so every agent follows the same proven approach. "How to do it."
```bash
chub get pw-community/login-flows    # fetch a skill
```

Both are markdown with YAML frontmatter, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard — compatible with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and other AI tools.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `chub search [query]` | Search docs and skills (no query = list all) |
| `chub get <ids...>` | Fetch docs or skills by ID |
| `chub annotate <id> <note>` | Attach a note to a doc or skill |
| `chub annotate <id> --clear` | Remove an annotation |
| `chub annotate --list` | List all annotations |
| `chub feedback <id> <up\|down>` | Rate a doc or skill (sent to maintainers) |

For the full list of commands, flags, and piping patterns, see the [CLI Reference](docs/cli-reference.md).

## Self-Improving Agents

Context Hub is designed for a loop where agents get better over time.

**Annotations** are local notes that agents attach to docs. They persist across sessions and appear automatically on future fetches — so agents learn from past experience. See [Feedback and Annotations](docs/feedback-and-annotations.md).

**Feedback** (up/down ratings with optional labels) goes to doc authors, who update the content based on what's working and what isn't. The docs get better for everyone — not just your local annotations.

## Key Features

### Incremental Fetch

Docs can have multiple reference files beyond the main entry point. Fetch only what you need — no wasted tokens. Use `--file` to grab specific references, or `--full` for everything. See the [CLI Reference](docs/cli-reference.md).

### Private Content Repo — *Coming Soon*

Teams need their own internal docs alongside the public registry: deployment playbooks, coding conventions, internal API references. See [Private Content Repo](docs/private-content.md).

### Annotations & Feedback

Annotations are local notes that agents attach to docs — they persist across sessions and appear automatically on future fetches. Feedback (up/down ratings) goes to doc authors to improve the content for everyone. See [Feedback and Annotations](docs/feedback-and-annotations.md).

## Contributing

Anyone can contribute docs and skills — API providers, framework authors, and the community. Content is plain markdown with YAML frontmatter, submitted as pull requests. See the [Content Guide](docs/content-guide.md) for the format and structure.

Agent feedback (up/down ratings from real usage) flows back to authors, helping surface what needs fixing and improving overall quality over time.
